\title{Invisible Fence model selection (Linear Mixed Model)}
\usage{
IF.lmer(full, data, B = 100, REML = TRUE, method = c("marginal",
  "conditional"), cpus = parallel::detectCores(), lftype = c("abscoef",
  "tvalue"))
}
\arguments{
\item{full}{formula of full model}

\item{data}{data}

\item{B}{number of bootstrap sample, parametric for lmer}

\item{REML}{Restricted maximum likelihood estimation}

\item{method}{choose either marginal (e.g., GEE) or conditional model}

\item{cpus}{Number of parallel computers}

\item{lftype}{subtractive measure type, e.g., absolute value of coefficients, p-value, t-value, etc.}
}
\value{
\item{full}{list the full model}
\item{B}{list the number of bootstrap samples that have been used}
\item{freq}{list the coverage probabilities of the selected model for each dimension}
\item{size}{list the number of variables in the parsimonious model}
\item{term}{list variables included in the full model}
\item{model}{list the variables selected in-the-order in the parsimonious model}
 @note The current Invisible Fence focuses on variable selection. The current routine is applicable to the case in which
 the subtractive measure is the absolute value of the coefficients, p-value, t-value.
 However, the method can be extended to other subtractive measures.  See Jiang et. al (2011) for more details.

\description{
Invisible Fence model selection (Linear Mixed Model)
}
\details{
This method (Jiang et. al, 2011) is motivated by computational expensive in complex and high dimensional problem.
The idea of the method--there is the best model in each dimension (in model space).  The boostrapping determines the coverage
probability of the selected model in each dimensions. The parsimonious model is the selected model with the highest coverage probabily
(except the one for the full model, always probability of 1.)

# Similarly, the following scenarios can be run

# obj2.lmer = IF.lmer(full = full, data = data, B = 100, method="conditional",lftype = "tvalue")
# sort(obj2.lmer$model)
# obj1.lm = IF.lmer(full = full, data = data, B = 100, method="marginal", lftype = "abscoef")
# sort(names(obj1.lm$model$coefficients[-1]))
# obj2.lm = IF.lmer(full = full, data = data, B = 100, method="marginal", lftype = "tvalue")
